# Fashion-Era Admin Dashboard - Error Fixes

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Admin API Endpoints**
**Problem**: The admin dashboard was trying to call `/api/admin/log-error` and `/api/admin/report-error` endpoints that didn't exist in the backend.

**Solution**: Added the missing admin API endpoints to `mongodb-backend.cjs`:
- `POST /api/admin/log-error` - Logs admin errors to MongoDB
- `POST /api/admin/report-error` - Updates error reports with user descriptions

### 2. **Socket.IO Dependency Issues**
**Problem**: The `useAdminRealtime` hook was trying to connect to a Socket.IO server that wasn't set up, causing connection errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed Socket.IO dependency from the hook
- Implemented mock real-time functionality for demo purposes
- Added simulated dashboard data updates
- Maintained the same API interface for future Socket.IO integration

### 3. **Error Boundary API Failures**
**Problem**: The `AdminErrorBoundary` component was failing when trying to log errors to non-existent endpoints.

**Solution**:
- Added proper error handling for API failures
- Implemented fallback logging for demo mode
- Enhanced user feedback for both success and failure cases
